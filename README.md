# Riemann-Stieltjes Integrated Grad-CAM (RSI-Grad-CAM)

This is an implementation of a variation of Grad-CAM in which gradients are replaced with integrated gradients at the layer level. Like Grad-CAM, it can be applied at the layer level, and like Integrated Gradients it is not affected by the problem of vanishing gradients when the (post-softmax) outputs get saturated. For efficiency, gradient integration is performed numerically at the layer level using a Riemann-Stieltjes sum approximation. Additional information can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10900) and [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-20713-6_20). Note that this method uses post-softmax outputs of the network rather than the pre-softmax scores recommended for Grad-CAM - more on advantages and disadvantages of the use of pre and post-softmax scores can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13197) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03305).
